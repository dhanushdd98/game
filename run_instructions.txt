	Please find the attached source file "main.cpp". I have done programming in C++ language.I used an online code editor and compiler the link to which is "https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c++_compiler#". Please run the program.
	I have done the problem "Ball Brick" as part of the interview process of ZOHO recruitment. I finished entire part of the problem given.


Working of the program:-

	Enter inputs in the same format as given in the question instructions.
	For Question 3, whenever a demolishing brick(DS,DE) is broken the demolishing process is carried out.
	For Question 5 the instructions were not fully understood. When a power brick(B) is hit for the first time,the ball base is formed in the bottom middle and the very next right.On further hits of (B)bricks base is incremented in left side and right side alternately.

Note-Tab space is not used when displaying matrix similiar to sample output given in question.
